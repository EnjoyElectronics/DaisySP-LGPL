# DaisySP-LGPL
DSP Modules under the LGPL license for running on Daisy and elsewhere.  
This repository does not work on its own, and is intended only as a submodule for [DaisySP](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP/)

## Distribution
If you distribute code that makes use of the DaisySP-LGPL, you are obligated to give end users the option to recompile with the LGPL library having been replaced.
To make this easier, we have provided a script called libDaisy/core/gather_lgpl.sh which can gather the required files with a simple build system for that purpose.
